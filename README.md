Hello, these are all of my simulations of newtownian gravity!

These use the equation a = G * m / r^2 to find the acceleration due to gravity between objects, where a is the acceleration, G is the gravitational constant (6.67430*10^-11),
m is the mass of the object that this object is being attracted to, and r is the distance between the two objects.
